# doodoobase
Database system embracing the Scatological Model

`doodoobase` is the new db in town.

- We got drop-once, stain-everywhere
- We got white/brown tree resource allocation
- We got atomic `DOODOO` operations
- We got fecal transactions
- Out of bandwidth? Just add more sharts
- We got disgust-based security
- Forget `JOIN`, try `MUSH`
- `JSON`.
